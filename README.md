# unit-4-game
This is for a project for my 4 week of class @ the Georgia Tech Bootcamp

This game was built using javascript and jquery.  You play the game by picking a player from the REBEL side and then fighting all the enemys in the DARK SIDE.  If you win or loose a song will play and give you an option to play again.
